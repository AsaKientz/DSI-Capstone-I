## Overview
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment tool that describes human behavior as a function of different preferences around the use of perception and judgement.  
The Indicator is a 4-letter type, with each letter representing a preference in one of 4 dichotomies:
- **s :** - Introversion (I) or Extraversion (E)
- **Information Gathering:** - Intuition (N) or Sensing (S)
- **Decision Making:** Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)
- **Structure:** - Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)

## Data Source Description
I used a Kaggle dataset of discussion forum posts at an MBTI-centered site. Two columns are present - the self-reported MBTI type of a user (one user per row) and a set of 50 posts for that user, listed as a single string, separated by a triple pipe ‘|||’.

I was interested to understand how aspects of personality could be detected from posting activity, and what trends within posts may exist that align with the reported personality types.

## Which Personalities Talk About Personalities?
What kind of MBTI Type tends to be attracted to a discussion forum on MBTI types?  
Perhaps understandably, the user base is heavily dominated by Intovert (I) and Intuition (N) types, with the top 4 being both I and N (66%).

One theory for the heavy skew in INxx could be that these types tend to explore information and patterns deeply, so a site where they can discuss their

## Bag of words / SKLearn

### Data Prep and Cleaning
The 8675 

### CountVectorizer
  use sklearn stopwords removed ~318 high frequency words from CountVectorizer results
    *** Explore custom stopword list ***
  set "min_df" to 2 (eliminates words in one one doc) - reduced corpus from ~145k words to ~50k words
  tf-idf - similar words in all types.  Used stopwords list, but need to expand.  Added cusom stopword list - some hocus-pocus, but does it pass the "are you an interesting word?" test?

### Word Clouds
  using tf-idf scoring for top 200 words in each word cloud, I made a string of words for a word cloud.  This strgin was generated by multiplying each word's score by 1000, rounding to nearest integer, and adding the word that many times to the string wiht spacing.
  Important to set 'Collocations = False' or the word cloud will generate word pairs given the list is sorted by duplicates

## Future improvements
 Additional cleaning of word list!  Stemming, Lemmatization
